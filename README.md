**What This Shows:**
The market exhibits distinct pricing tiers across property categories. New buildings command premium prices with a median of 119K AZN, while rental properties show significantly lower entry points at 52K AZN median.

**Business Impact:**

- **Target Segmentation**: The gap between median and average prices indicates high-value outliers in each segment, suggesting opportunities for luxury market positioning

## 2. Geographic Market Concentration

### Finding: Extreme Geographic Concentration Creates Risk and Opportunity

![Supply by Region](charts/02_supply_by_region.png)

**What This Shows:**
The top 5 regions account for the overwhelming majority of listings, with Baku city alone representing 97% of the market. Yasamal, Nərimanov, and Nəsimi districts lead within Baku.

**Business Impact:**
- **Market Saturation**: High concentration in specific districts may indicate oversupply and pricing pressure
- **Expansion Opportunities**: The 37 regional listings (3%) represent an underserved market with potential for growth
- **Competitive Intensity**: Dense competition in Yasamal and Nərimanov requires differentiation strategies
- **Risk Exposure**: Heavy reliance on Baku makes the market vulnerable to city-specific economic shocks

**Recommended Actions:**
- Investigate regional markets for first-mover advantages and less competition
- In saturated districts, compete on service quality and digital presence rather than price
- Diversify portfolio across multiple districts to reduce concentration risk

## 3. Room Count Pricing Dynamics

### Finding: Non-Linear Price Scaling by Property Size

![Price by Rooms](charts/03_price_by_rooms.png)

**What This Shows:**
Median prices increase with room count, but not proportionally. The jump from 3-room to 4-room properties shows the steepest price increase, while market supply heavily concentrates in 2-3 room properties.

**Business Impact:**
- **Sweet Spot Identification**: 2-3 room properties represent the highest volume market segment
- **Premium Market Gap**: 4+ room properties command significant premiums but represent smaller market share
- **Investment Efficiency**: Price-per-room efficiency peaks at 2-3 rooms, making them optimal for rental yield strategies
- **Luxury Market Opportunity**: Limited supply of 5+ room properties creates opening for high-end developments

**Recommended Actions:**
- Prioritize 2-3 room developments for maximum market absorption
- Position 4+ room properties as premium offerings with lifestyle benefits
- Consider splitting larger properties into 2-3 room units to optimize returns

## 4. Listing Engagement & Market Demand Signals

### Finding: Higher Engagement Correlates with Lower Prices - Volume Market Rules

![Engagement Analysis](charts/04_engagement_analysis.png)

**What This Shows:**
Most listings receive low to medium engagement (<500 views), but interestingly, properties with higher view counts tend to have lower median prices. The viral engagement category (>2K views) shows the lowest median prices at around 62K AZN.

**Business Impact:**
- **Pricing Strategy**: Lower-priced properties generate more buyer interest and platform traffic
- **Market Accessibility**: The inverse price-engagement relationship confirms strong demand at affordable price points
- **Marketing Efficiency**: Properties priced under 100K naturally attract more attention, reducing marketing costs
- **Volume Opportunity**: High engagement at lower price points validates volume-based business models
- **Premium Challenge**: Higher-priced properties require targeted marketing as they generate less organic traffic

**Recommended Actions:**
- Price competitively to maximize organic visibility and reduce time-to-sale
- For premium properties, invest in targeted marketing rather than relying on platform traffic
- Platform operators should optimize for high-volume, affordable segment where engagement is highest
- Use engagement data to identify mispriced properties (high price + high views may indicate negotiation opportunity)

## 5. Property Size Distribution

### Finding: Market Favors Mid-Size Properties

![Property Size Distribution](charts/06_property_size_distribution.png)

**What This Shows:**
The market clusters around 75-150m² properties (45% of listings), with relatively fewer small (<50m²) and large (>200m²) properties.

**Business Impact:**
- **Demand Signal**: The concentration suggests buyer preference for family-sized homes over studios or mansions
- **Supply Gap**: Only 12% of properties are under 50m², indicating potential undersupply of affordable starter homes
- **Luxury Segment**: The 15% of properties over 200m² represent a niche but substantial luxury market
- **Standardization Opportunity**: The 75-150m² range allows for standardized designs and construction efficiencies

**Recommended Actions:**
- Design projects targeting the 75-150m² segment for fastest absorption
- Explore micro-apartment concepts (<50m²) for young professionals and students
- Develop luxury offerings (>200m²) with high margins for the premium segment

## 6. Seller Type Competitive Landscape

### Finding: Agent-Dominated Market with Price Parity

![Seller Type Analysis](charts/07_seller_type_analysis.png)

**What This Shows:**
Agents control 77% of listings but show similar median prices to owner-direct sales. This indicates agents aren't just handling premium properties.

**Business Impact:**
- **Market Professionalization**: High agent involvement suggests buyers expect professional service and documentation
- **Commission Economics**: With 882 agent listings, commission-based revenue opportunity is substantial
- **Direct Sale Opportunity**: 23% owner-direct sales indicate comfort with FSBO (For Sale By Owner) approach
- **Price Competitiveness**: No significant price premium for agent listings suggests efficient market pricing

**Recommended Actions:**
- Real estate platforms should cater to both agents (volume) and owners (emerging segment)
- Agents should focus on service differentiation rather than exclusive access to lower prices
- Technology platforms can capture value by reducing agent dependency for simpler transactions

## 7. Price Range Accessibility

### Finding: Market Skews Toward Affordable Segment

![Price Range Distribution](charts/08_price_range_distribution.png)

**What This Shows:**
45% of properties are priced under 100K AZN, making the market relatively accessible. However, a significant luxury segment (9%) exists above 500K AZN.

**Business Impact:**
- **Affordability Crisis Prevention**: Nearly half the market remains under 100K, supporting middle-class homeownership
- **Financing Opportunity**: The 100-300K range (33% of market) aligns with typical mortgage affordability
- **Luxury Stability**: The 9% premium segment (>500K) indicates healthy demand at high price points
- **Missing Middle**: The 200-300K range is underrepresented, suggesting a gap in mid-tier offerings

**Recommended Actions:**
- Financial institutions should target the 100-300K segment for mortgage products
- Developers should address the 200-300K gap with quality mid-tier options
- Luxury developers can focus on the stable >500K market with differentiated offerings
